Documentation
======================

 Your script can retrieve a file generated from the Data Export Scheduler tool 
in the MAP system and copy it to a URL or file location of your choice. 
The retrievable file types are:
     - Comprehensive Data File
     - Combined Data File
     - CompassLearning(R) XML File

 You continue to schedule data exports in the MAP user interface as usual, 
with a maximum frequency of one file export per day. A script lets you bypass 
the MAP user interface to retrieve the file. You can also manually download the 
same file through the user interface.

See the MAP online help for information about scheduling and retrieving data
export files through the user interface.
